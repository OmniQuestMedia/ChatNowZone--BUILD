## One-Line Summary

ChatNow.Zone core build is complete and canonical-compliant across all 10 payloads;
all retired membership tiers have been replaced with the locked six-tier enum
(`GUEST` / `VIP` / `VIP_SILVER` / `VIP_GOLD` / `VIP_PLATINUM` / `VIP_DIAMOND`),
ZONE_MAP and service logic updated accordingly, and the repo is ready for Alpha Launch pending CEO sign-off.

## Next Human Steps

1. **Pixel Legacy onboarding** — activate the `pixel_legacy` flag workflow for the first 3,000 pre-launch creator registrants per `PROGRAM_CONTROL/LAUNCH_MANIFEST.md`.
2. **Payment processor testing** — verify Stripe / processor integration end-to-end with test cards across all billing intervals (MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, SEMI_ANNUAL, ANNUAL).
3. **CEO launch clearance sign-off** — CEO must sign clearance artifact in `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/` before any GOV gate is cleared for production.
4. **`legal_holds.correlation_id` migration** — author and execute the FIZ/GOV-scoped schema migration to add `correlation_id` to `legal_holds` (flagged in `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` §7).
5. **Wave B–H directives** — remaining items in `docs/REQUIREMENTS_MASTER.md` (Risk Engine, OBS Broadcast Kernel, FairPay + NOWPayouts, RedBook, pixel_legacy rate-lock) require directive authoring in Claude Chat before execution. The G101+ "Black-Glass Interface" line item was retired 2026-05-06 — see `archive/G101-BLACK-GLASS-RETIRED-2026-05-06/`.
6. **GateGuard Sentinel LOI + federated lookup** — GGS scaffold is complete; LOI and federated AV lookup remain NEEDS_DIRECTIVE.
7. **Hard launch deadline** — 2026-10-01 per `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` §1.
